# Week 2 - TA Teaching Guide

Slides and timing (50 minute course)

### Welcome Slide
encourage students to start talking / asking the questions as they arrive to class 
(about five minutes before class starts)


### Warm Up Problem
Spend about 10 minutes on this, including the time to explain it, and the solution. 
This means about 5 minutes for the think-pair-share activity. 

### Video ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvyTEx1wyOY])
About five minutes for the video, 4 minutes for discussion. Have students attempt to define
it by discussion (no need to have them share outside of their groups)

- time 20-25 minutes into the session

### What is computer science
This activity is meant to prepare them for next week. We are actually introducing them to
design thinking, by encouraging them to spend the week thinking about ways **computer science can
be used to improve the immediate world around them**. 
* Empathise – with your users 
* Define – your users’ needs, their problem, and your insights
* Ideate – by challenging assumptions and creating ideas for innovative solutions
* Prototype – to start creating solutions
* Test – solutions

- time 25-30 minutes into the class

### Debugging and Errors
The slide is an intro, come up with examples for the students to see
for most of the errors (runtime is hard at this point). 

- remainder of the time + questions from students (note, we will have more and more time for questions future weeks)
