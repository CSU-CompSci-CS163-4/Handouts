# Week 3 - TA Teaching Guide

Warm up question - meant to remind students to relax as they 
study for exams next week (they probably have them in multiple classes).

### Empathize Problems
* we are teaching the first stage of design thinking  
  it is meant to be an "observation" stage
* Encourage open-ended questions, "what are some groups affected by this application?", 
"Can different cultures view it differently?", "What are some solutions to the problem"

We want them to think about it in an application sense. 

Discourage other students from giving solutions. This is about generating questions,
so the student can try to find the answers. 

### Methods
This section focuses on methods, their purpose. Most of it should be explained
via coding problems

For this course, we are teaching that *every* method they write, should be tested!
The tests should be fun before writing other methods, which often means setting up
code to run tests first.
