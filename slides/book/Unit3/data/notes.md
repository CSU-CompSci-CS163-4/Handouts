# My Notes!

This is my series of notes about the class
mark down is neat, and if i was doing this in the console, I would just be typing 
and hitting return, until I got to the end

* is how markdown displays bullets
* so each start is a bullet
   * indented bullet
   * hard to see as they have to align up..

thank you and good bye
