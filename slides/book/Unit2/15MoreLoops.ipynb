    "I used to include this on my slides, but since these slides have changed - going to just leave it up here for every notebook. I get a lot of questions about more programming courses, the concentrations, and minors in computer science. Here is a brief reminder.\n",

    "CS 165 – Next Course In Sequence, also consider CS 220 (math and stats especially) \n",
    "* CO Jobs Report 2021 – 77% of *all* new jobs in Colorado require programming\n",
    "* 60% of all STEM jobs requires *advanced* (200-300 level) \n",
    "* 31% of all Bachelor of Arts degree titled jobs also required coding skills \n",
